Prompt Version 1: Direct Approach
The first prompt was straightforward. It asked the model to identify the necessary tables based on a specific user query: “Give me a list of employees who work in the sales department.”

Results:

The model correctly identified the relevant tables, returning them in JSON format as requested.
No extraneous information was added, and the response was clean and focused.
Conclusion: This approach worked efficiently. Clear instructions yielded precise results.

Prompt Version 2: Contextual Approach
The second prompt was more open-ended, treating GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert. The user query was: “Which employees have not received a raise in the last two years?”

Results:

The model returned the correct tables but added unnecessary explanations.
In one case, it included an irrelevant table, indicating minor hallucination.
Conclusion: While this approach allowed for reasoning, it introduced unnecessary complexity and occasional errors.
